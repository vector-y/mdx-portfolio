Over the course of my senior year at Long Beach State, I was able to conceptualize
a product and develop it from the ground up with a team of 3 other students.

I worked on a lot of different aspects of the projects including:

- Creating the problem statement and solution for our product
- Designing the theme, and wireframes for different parts of the web app
- Being the front end engineer

```javascript:hello.js
const hello = 'Hello, world!'
var x = 6

if (x > 5)
    console.log(hello)
```
