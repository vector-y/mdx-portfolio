Urspace Labs is a 10-week fellowship program I entered in the Summer of 2020. The program was for students who did not have an internship or job lined up that summer.
Like a cross between a bootcamp and an accelerator, I was coached by the program directors through the basics of product development—from ideation to research to design to development.

I used [divjoy](https://divjoy.com/) to help generate the integrated react code base with another fellow engineer.

I worked on customizing basic react components for data visualization. Here's an example of the code snippet!

The rest of the code base: [Coingo's Github](https://github.com/cv-es/coingo)

```javascript:Chart.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Bar, Line, Pie } from "react-chartjs-2";

class Chart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      chartData: {
        labels: ["Victor", "Sofia", "Emily", "Charlotte"],
        datasets: [
          {
            label: "Members",
            data: [100, 200, 300, 400],
            backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.75)",
          },
        ],
      },
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="chart">
        <Line
          data={this.state.chartData}
          options={{ maintainAspectRatio: false }}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Chart;
```
