Urspace Labs is a 10-week fellowship program we ran in 2020 for students who did not have an internship or job lined up that summer.
Like a cross between a bootcamp and an accelerator, we coached newcomers in tech through the basics of product development—from ideation to research to design to development.

```javascript:hello.js
const hello = 'Hello, world!'
var x = 6

if (x > 5)
    console.log(hello)
```
