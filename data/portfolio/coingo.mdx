Urspace Labs is a 10-week fellowship program I entered in the Summer of 2020. The program was for students who did not have an internship or job lined up that summer.
Like a cross between a bootcamp and an accelerator, I was coached by the program directors through the basics of product development—from ideation to research to design to development.
