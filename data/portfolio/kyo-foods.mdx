## About

Weâ€™re motivated to bring college students healthy & affordable Japanese meals to Los Angeles County. Kyo Foods aims to create a holistic eating experience to improve the health & wellbeing of our customers.

## My Role

User research, wireframing, designing logic flow of the service. Worked on designing high fidelity UI, visuals, and prototyping.

## Background

Personally as a college student I'm constantly busy with classes, work, & commitments. Healthy meals are far & few between sometimes because of costs.

## Problem Statement

College students don't have access to eat nutritious simple delicious food because of the following:

1. Costs
   - Students struggle with staying within a certain budget due to cost restraints from early career income.
2. Access
   - Locations that offer these foods are typically out of reach.
3. Unaware of Resources
   - Students don't know about some foods outside of their own culture, etc.
