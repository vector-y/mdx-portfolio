Botan is an in-person rooftop community gardening service that aims to reconnect the community through hands-on agricultural education, events, & volunteering.

# Problem Statement

Climate change & wealth inequality arenâ€™t seperate issues.

Design goals to challenge climate change on a community level:

1. Rooftop gardening to elevate social gardening
   - Immersive environments dedicated to gardening will offer new opportunities to the community
2. Create a safe haven for learning and discovery
   - Allow anyone from all ages to come in and learn how to garden and connect with nature again
3. Reconnect the Community
   - Community events and workshops to help others make new friends in the same physical space at Botan locations
