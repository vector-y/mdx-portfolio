## About

Botan is a rooftop community gardening service that aims to reconnect the community through hands-on agricultural education, events/workshops, & volunteering in person at Botan locations.

## My Role

User research, wireframing, designing logic flow of the service. Worked on designing high fidelity UI, visuals, and prototyping.

## Background

Personally as a college student I'm constantly busy with classes, work, & commitments. Healthy meals are far & few between sometimes because of costs.

## Problem Statement

Climate change & wealth inequality arenâ€™t seperate issues due to some systemic issues such as:

1. Costs
   - Students struggle with staying within a certain budget due to cost restraints from early career income.
2. Access
   - Locations that offer these foods are typically out of reach.
3. Unaware of Resources
   - Students don't know about some foods outside of their own culture, etc.

### Analysis

Botan will help track a plant's growth over time and help record the nutrients that users put into their soil in order to back progress with numbers.

### Locations

Users are able to quickly locate and favorite the closest physical Botan locations based on zip code to their homes for ease of access.
