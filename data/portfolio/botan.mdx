Botan is an in-person rooftop community gardening service that aims to reconnect the community through hands-on agricultural education, events, & volunteering at Botan locations.

## Problem Statement

Climate change & wealth inequality aren’t seperate issues. People in communities across the country are struggling with adverse effects from climate change such as:

1. The desire to learn how to help, but not sure what methods will be effective
   - Users have a vast amount of information on climate change, but putting their thoughts to action need a simple solution
2. People feel helpless against the seemingly inveitable climate crisis
   - Users need to take back control and have ways they can come together to help influence positive change
3. Need to measure how their impact will make a difference (seeing the numbers from their work)
   - Users want to know what progress they've made to reduce climate change

### Analysis

Botan will help track a plant's growth over time and help record through metrics such as plant height, leaf count, leaf surface area, and more.

## My Role

User research, wireframing, designing logic flow of the service. Worked on designing high fidelity UI, visuals, and prototyping.

## Design Goals

Design goals to challenge climate change on a community level:

1. Rooftop gardening to elevate social gardening
   - Immersive environments dedicated to gardening will offer new opportunities to the community
2. Create a safe haven for learning and discovery
   - Allow anyone from all ages to come in and learn how to garden and connect with nature again
3. Reconnect the Community
   - Community events and workshops to help others make new friends in the same physical space at Botan locations

## Research Insights

![heat graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-y/mdx-portfolio/main/public/heat%20data.png)

1. Cities with low median of income suffer from heat the most

![emissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-y/mdx-portfolio/main/public/building%20emissions.png)

2. Heating & cooling is responsible for about 50% of building emissions which account for a third of global emissions

## User Types

1. Vincent
   - 22, Kinesiology Student
   - "I'm trying to learn how to take care of my new plants, but the exprience feels lonely."
2. Tiffany
   - 31, Yoga Teacher
   - "I wish I could help spread my knowledge about plants to others without having to create my own community."

## Key Insight

Through combining the pain points of Vincent and Tiffany, we can transform the research results into three “how might we” questions, which will serve as the core focus as we continue onto ideation.

1. Develop a learning community centered around gardening & agriculture.

2. Provide a safe and open environment for anyone to come in to learn.

3. Create sustainable relationships that rewards loyalty with measurable progress.

## Design Requirements

1. **Unique**
   - Our design should showcase this unique new social gardening experience to its fullest potential
2. **Promote learning through volunteering and workshops**
   - Our design should be able to streamline the process to sign up to learn or volunteer in workshops
3. **Easy to understand**
   - Our design needs to quickly and effectively communicate the analytics that users are looking to know about their plants
